# dotfiles
After watching a video [NEVER lose dotfiles again with GNU Stow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoFiYOqnC4o) I interested to do it for self dotfiles without Stow util. For it i desided to use a simple shell script to creating links to my dotfiles from my dotfiles folder.

## How to use
Clone git repo to home folder and run shell script for creating links to dotfiles are containing in dotfile folder.
